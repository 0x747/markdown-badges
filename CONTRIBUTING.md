# Contributing to markdown-badges

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following steps are a set of guidelines for contributing to markdown-badges:

### Steps:

1. Create a fork of the existing repository. This will be your local copy where you can propose new changes.
2. Update the local clone or make changes directly on the forked repo, adding a badge with its appropriate hex-color in the given format:

```
   ![Badge Name](https://img.shields.io/badge/<badge>-%23<badge-color>.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=<badge>&logoColor=<logo-color>)
```

Replace the following: `<badge>` , `<badge-color>` , `<logo-color>`

**Important:** All of the badges are ordered alphabetically. Hence, while contributing, make sure to order to add the new badges in an alphabetical order.

3. Create a Pull Request with your proposed changes. 
4. Once the Pull Request is created, set a label on the Pull Request. The Pull Request must be labelled to easily identify what kind of a Pull Request it is.  You can add one or more labels to the pull request. The most common labels are described as below:
- `typo-fix`: fix one or more badges (this includes errorneous logos or color schemes).
- `new-badge`: add one or more new badges
- `new-section`: add one or more new sections
- `enhancement`: reshuffle badges in different sections

You are all done with the steps! 

#### Thanks again to ALL the amazing contributors!
